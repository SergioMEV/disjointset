# Disjoint Set
Implementation of Disjoint Set data structure in Java. 
Done as a project for class where we could implement any data structure from scratch.
Read up on Disjoint Sets using [_Introduction to Algorithms_](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844). 
Very good textbook on algorithms, highly recommended.
